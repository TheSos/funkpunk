# funkpunk v0.0
#### *Flashpunk modified to use GPU rendering!*

## Current state
It *"just works"* This is the initial version that displays sutuff properly using Flash display lists. I only use a subset of FP features in my games so try and plug it in! Let me know what's there left to do!

## TODO
- layering
- resource management
- scaling and pixels
- console
- pixelbuffer overlay
- probably heaps of stuff
 
## Usage
Substitute **net/flashpunk** directory from your project with this. Compile. Cry. *(TODO: replace 'cry' with 'rejoice')*
